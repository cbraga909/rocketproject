# rocketproject
Final project for Programming Applications for Engineers class from Fall 2017 semester <br/>
Goal was to design, build, and program rocket payload with the following requirements:<br/>
Record at least three data strings plus time data using at least two unique devices. Sample data that could be recorded included: <br/>
acceleration<br/>
angular rate<br/>
magnetic field<br/>
pressure<br/>
pitot tube velocity readings<br/>
dust particle count<br/>
strain deformation<br/>
Data from each sensor needed to be recorded in some form of permanent storage and had to have some unique signifier to distinguish trials<br/>
Data needed to be stored at a rate of at least 20hz. Acceptable storage included SD card, external EEPROM, external flash memory, or real time telemetry<br/>
Payload needed to only start recording data after launch, needed an audio signifier to indicate power, and a separate signifier to indicate data collection<br/>
Payload needed to survive rocket launch and collect data through entire run, and needed to run from provided 9V battery<br/>
Additional requirement was to model the rocket in VPython and show live data from this<br/>
